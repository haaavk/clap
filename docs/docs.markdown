# RedCLAP documentation

This documentation is written to help programmers learn
how to create RedCLAP interfaces quickly and painlessly.
It is composed mostly of examples with descriptions explaining
the code.

Each subdirectory contains at least three files:

- `ui.json`: UI description,
- `program.py`: a Python program loading interface from `ui.json`,
- `README.markdown`: a short description of the example,
